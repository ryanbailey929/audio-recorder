# py-audio-recorder

A python3 program I created to record audio that can be started and stopped by the user at runtime.

It seems like it should be simple but I couldn't find a good example of it online and it took me quite a while to get right. I hope that this will be found by (and useful to) all looking to do this.

Dependencies: pyaudio
